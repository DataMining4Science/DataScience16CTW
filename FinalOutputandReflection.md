#### Assessment evidence and interpretation: 
When you turned in your project proposal you detailed an assessment plan for your project.  In your final reflection, please provide any evidence that you think will be helpful in evaluating your project.   If the only relevant piece of evidence is your final output, that is totally fine, however, if there are other pieces of evidence (visualization mockups, ipython notebooks from models you didn't wind up using, data explorations, etc.) make sure to point those out.  In addition to listing these sources of evidence, please provide a brief interpretation of how they help inform the assessment of your project.

#### Changing the world: 
Do you think your project has the potential to change the world?  If not, why?  If so, what are the next steps to make this happen?

We do not think that the output of our project will change the world (other than in a butterfly effect fashion). We weren't able to produce a very acurate model, and none of the visualizations we developed were intened to be anything other than exploration tools for ourselves. We hope that seeing our project might inspire someone else to do something impactful but that's about all the impact we for see this having.

#### Learning goals: 

Our stated learning goals were: "We want to learn more about the healthcare system ourselves as well as gain experience in taking a data set, understanding it, and making it useful."

Overall we feel we achieved our learning goals. We did learn more about how medicare works from a billing/organizational perspective. There is still a huge amount we don't know but we think we made progress. We also feel like we absoltely gained more experience in taking a data set, transfomring the data and trying to make it useful (Even if we're not sure how useful our final out put is).
