# Change the World Proposal

**Who is on the project team?**
Mac-I and Jacob

**What is the main idea of the project?  What is your MVP?  What are your stretch goals?**
The idea is to investigate inpatient hospital procedure costs and payments across the USA.
Our MVP is a model that will predict the cost for a given procedure in a given place.
Our stretch goal is to create a nice web interface for our model.

**In what way will it change the world?  Why do you care about changing the world in this way?**
It will help people be more informed about the cost of healthcare procedures.
We care because the healthcare system in the USA is unfathomably complex and confusing.

**What do you want to learn through doing this project?**
We want to learn more about the healthcare system ourselves as well as gain experience in taking a data set, understanding it, and making it useful.

**Where will you get the data for your project?**
https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/kd35-nmmt

**What form will your final deliverable will take?**
A Jupyter notebook containing our exploration, model, and final predictive algorithm.  If we achieve our stretch goal, there will be a web interface.

**What will your workflow be while working on this project?  How will this workflow support successful collaboration with your teammate?**
We will use Jupyter notebooks, separately or collaboratively depending on which is more appropriate for a given goal.  We will meet to share any individual findings, merge separate notebooks if need be, and plan our next steps.

**Where are you planning to be with this project by the mid-project checkin?**
We plan to have explored the data, made any necessary recodes, and started looking into models.

**How should your final deliverable be assessed?**
It should be assessed by how well we conducted our exploration and model creation, as well as how well we achieve our learning goals.
Without diving into the data too much yet, we are not sure how reasonable it is to expect that we can create a highly accurate model or a particularly compelling visualization, but ideally these would also be part of the assessment plan.
