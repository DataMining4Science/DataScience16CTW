#### Assessment evidence and interpretation:

Our initial assessment plan: "It should be assessed by how well we conducted our exploration and model creation, as well as how well we achieve our learning goals."

In order for you to assess us in this manner we think it would be heloful for you to look at the following files/notebooks:

data_exploration_j.ipynb - This is were we explored the data

geolocate.py (initial attempt with open sources) and geolocate2.py (final attempt using google API) - thise was our code
for geocoding the addresses of hospitals into latitude and longitude

loadAndClean.py - this is where we prepared our data for modeling

model_exploration.ipynb - our exploration of different models

knn_gridsearch.ipynb - k-nearest neighbor grid search\

RandomForest_gridsearch.ipynb - ramdon forest grid search

writeup.ipynb - our final writeup


#### Changing the world: 

We do not think that the output of our project will change the world (other than in a butterfly effect fashion). We weren't able to produce a very acurate model, and none of the visualizations we developed were intened to be anything other than exploration tools for ourselves. We hope that seeing our project might inspire someone else to do something impactful but that's about all the impact we for see this having.

#### Learning goals: 

Our stated learning goals were: "We want to learn more about the healthcare system ourselves as well as gain experience in taking a data set, understanding it, and making it useful."

Overall we feel we achieved our learning goals. We did learn more about how medicare works from a billing/organizational perspective. There is still a huge amount we don't know but we think we made progress. We also feel like we absoltely gained more experience in taking a data set, transfomring the data and trying to make it useful (Even if we're not sure how useful our final out put is).
