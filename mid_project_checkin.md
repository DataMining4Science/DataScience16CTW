####Did you accomplish your goals?  If not, what happened?
At this point our stated goals were: "We plan to have explored the data, made any necessary recodes, and started looking into models." At this point we have done some data exploration (Obviously we haven't fully explored the data because that is an absurd thing to say at any point). We successfully recoded all the street addresses into Latitudes and longitudes. We have not really begun looking into models, this is simply due to the geocoding taking longer than expected. 

####What have you accomplished thus far in the project?  Make sure to provide pointers to any intermediate artifacts generated from your project.  These artifacts could be code, plots, data, etc.
We have done some data exploartion (see data exploration notebook). If you would like to see how we recoded the data see gelocate.py(Open sources) and geolocate.py (Bing/Google).


####What is the minimum viable product that you will have done by next Friday?  What are your stretch goals?
Our goals have not changed: "Our MVP is a model that will predict the cost for a given procedure in a given place. Our stretch goal is to create a nice web interface for our model."
